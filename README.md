It have few bugs, but currently I do more intresting for me project, so I don't even want to repair or do code more nice.
(I could put the bricks in clasess...)

Anyway: the game is completly RNG (because it's fun) and have 10 levels which are added evey 5 lines.
(Don't worry, for me the latest lvl is unplayable)
